    <h3>Definitions:</h3>

    <h4>Stakeholder: A stakeholder is an individual or a group that is directly or indirectly involved in trial-related
        activities, in addition to those that may have interests in the study or be affected by the results.</h4>

    <h4>Communication material: A communication material is the deliverable produced with the information that will be
        used for communication. </h4>

    <h4>Channel: The channel is the general means of transmission for a given communication / message.</h4>

    <h4>Responsible party: The responsible party is an individual or a group who has overall responsibility and
    accountability for ensuring that a given communication happens.</h4>

    <h3>General instructions:</h3>

    <h4>The communication plan for the LAKANA project identifies the project stakeholders, describes the purpose of
        communication, and identifies the channels, frequencies and products for a given communication. </h4>
    <h4>Stakeholders include the funder, sponsor, regulatory agencies, investigators, research institutions and
        universities, study participants, local communities, their representatives, national or local government
        authorities, the scientific community or members of the public. </h4>

    <h4>The communication purpose outlines the specific objective of the information that will be communicated to
        stakeholders in relation to their roles and responsibilities.</h4>

    <h4>The medium for sharing information will include four main channels:</h4>

    <h5><em>E-mail:</em>
        The LAKANA project coordinator at TAU will set up lists of e-mail addresses for the different working groups for
        the sharing of documents and information. The rules for e-mail use are established to avoid overload of e-mails.
        It will be the responsibility of each partner to ensure that relevant personnel are included in the mailing
        lists and to communicate any changes to the project coordinator at TAU. Individual e-mails will be addressed to
        targeted stakeholder(s) as needed.</h5>

    <h5><em>Face-to-face/online meetings:</em> A <a href="http://www.zoom.com">Zoom</a> virtual meeting room will be used for
        accommodating online meetings. Face-to-face meetings will be organized as needed.</h5>
