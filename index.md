### A Comparision of Machine Learning Methods for the Prediction of MRSA Infection in Surgical Patients

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of antibiotic resistance related mortality in surgical patients.1 Effective prediction of MRSA would facilitate the prophylactic use of appropriate antibiotics or application of other prevention techniques, which have been shown to improve clinical outcomes.2  While there is a range of patient, procedural and hospital level factors that have been shown to increase the risk of a surgical patient contracting a MRSA infection, research is less clear on the best approaches to developing predictive models for incorporation into a clinical decision support system. This study will compare two common modeling approaches — logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN)—for the prediction of MRSA infection in patients undergoing major surgical procedures (MSPs) in the United States.
